# T-Prior Variational Autoencoder (VAE)

This repository contains an implementation of the **T-Prior Variational Autoencoder (VAE)**, a model designed to mitigate the overregularization issue observed in traditional VAEs. The method leverages the unique properties of the t-distribution to improve generalization performance, particularly for outlier pattern identification.

---

## Introduction

Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) often suffer from overregularization due to the strong influence of the KL divergence term between the Gaussian prior and the encoderâ€™s Gaussian distribution. This results in reduced generalization performance.

To address this, we propose a **T-Prior VAE**, which uses a t-distributed latent space. The t-distribution, with its slower tail decay compared to the Gaussian, results in a lower KL divergence. This helps balance the trade-off between reconstruction accuracy and generalization.

## Key Features

1. **T-Distributed Latent Space**:
   - Slower tail decay reduces overregularization.
   - Improved generalization performance, especially for identifying outliers.

2. **Reparameterization Trick**:
   - Extended to support the t-distribution, leveraging its location-scale family properties.

3. **Hyperparameter Control**:
   - The parameter \( \nu \) adjusts the tail heaviness of the t-distribution:
     - **Large \( \nu \)**: Behaves like a Gaussian VAE.
     - **Small \( \nu \)**: May lead to poor learning due to heavy-tailed distribution.

## Loss Function

The model minimizes a modified evidence lower bound (ELBO):

\[
\mathcal{L} = \text{Reconstruction Loss} + \text{KL Divergence between t-distribution and prior}
\]

Monte Carlo approximations are used for efficient gradient computation.

## Implementation Details

- **Backpropagation**: Derivations account for the t-distribution's characteristics.
- **Decoder**: Remains consistent with standard VAEs.
- **KL Divergence**: Explicitly derived for the t-prior.
